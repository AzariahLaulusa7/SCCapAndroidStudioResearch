My name is Azariah Laulusa. I created a game for my small app using Android Studio, and I coded in Java. I followed an Android Game tutorial ("https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gfX8UHTpq3o") to create the base for the game and used Vector Icons ("https://www.flaticon.com/") for all the icon images, which I edited using Paint. My concept and some of my designs are different from the tutorial. I also changed the code to include more falling objects. There is more I want to add to the game, like plant reactions, and falling objects that will give you extra points.

In the path src/main/"java/com/example/guarden", you'll find the java code to the Guarden game. Like the name implies, your job is to guard the garden. This game includes a plant that is dragged left or right on the screen to avoid bugs and rocks. If the plant comes in contact with any rock or bug, it loses a life. The plant has three lives. If there are no more lives, the game ends.

In the path src/res/drawable, will be all the images I used for this game, and src/res/font has the font used for the text in the game.

Here is a short clip of the Guarden Game (full-screen view): [GuardenRecording.webm](https://github.com/SCCapstone/research-AzariahLaulusa7/assets/122847570/c3b32b4d-168a-4785-80c0-233c49ba4a69)

Here is a video of the process of running the Guarden Game on Android Studio: [20231015_210910 (1).webm](https://github.com/SCCapstone/research-AzariahLaulusa7/assets/122847570/27feb292-d903-4297-a6f5-8616039084a8)

Issues: I faced some issues while researching and working on this milestone. While running the game, the game just stops and exits. At first, it ran until I used all the lives. After running it several times, it just exits while in the middle of the game. This will be something I will work on and research more about if we will use this game in our app.
