In the path src/main/"java/com/example/guarden", you'll find the java code to the Guarden game. This game includes a plant that is dragged on the screen to avoid bugs and rocks. If the plant comes in contact with any roc or bug, it loses a life. The plant has three lives. If there are no more lives, the game ends.
In the path src/res/drawable, will be all the images I used for this game.
